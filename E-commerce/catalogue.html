         <p>Here are few reviews from our customers:</p>
         <blockquote>
            <p>"It's a nice smart watch. I've just started using it, so I'm yet to try all the features. The heart rate monitor and sleep tracking seems accurate. Tried the badminton mode in games. Yet to try answering calls from the watch, so I can't comment on the call quality yet. The battery doesn't last as claimed. My battery drained in 3 days although they claim 1 week. Apart from this, I liked the quality and ruggedness of the watch." -Binish Babu</p>
            <p>"A nice looking smartwatch with all necessary features. Had gifted it to my nephew and it was working wonderfully well. However, last week, one side of the top portion of the watch to which the strap is fixed, broke rendering it unusable. Taking up the issue with the support team as the watch is under the 1 year warranty period. Hope it will be fixed soon" -Linda</p>
